# Backlog — release

Ids: REL-10 (next free)

Things written but not live: migrations to apply (dev first, with the check to run after), secrets
to set, and checks nobody has run. Tick an item when it is done on every environment it names.
`docs/RELEASE-RUNBOOK.md` is the command-by-command form of REL-1, REL-3 and REL-7 (one push,
three sets of checks) and says how to paste the results back.

## Open

- [ ] Part 1 / Part 7: create branch protection on `main` with the Actions job checks `test`, `db`,
      `docker (api)`, `docker (voice)` and `docker (web)` as required checks, and enable Dependabot
      security updates (repository settings → Code security). `e2e` stays optional.
- [x] Done 2026-11-03 by the operator through `docs/RELEASE-RUNBOOK.md` (`REL-1`, `REL-3`,
      `REL-7`): the five migrations are on the dev project, `/db-types` regenerated
      `packages/db/src/database.ts` with `demo_items` and `demo_notes`, and the `DemoDatabase`
      cast in `packages/tools-demo` is dropped. The after-apply checks are the runbook's; paste
      anything that did not match back into the matching item.

- [ ] REL-9 · Step 0 of `docs/plan/10-integration-roadmap.md`: the first deploy on the hosts of
      decision 0013, step by step in `docs/DEPLOY-RUNBOOK.md` (`deploy/compose.prod.yml`,
      `deploy/Caddyfile`, `vercel.json` added 2026-11-03; `OPS-1` deferred, the images still run
      tsx). (a) Hetzner VM (Falkenstein, Docker, Caddy): the api and voice images from a
      tagged commit, secrets from the matrix in the host's env store, `CORS_ORIGINS` = the Vercel
      origin, `VOICE_AGENT_NAME` = `AGENT_NAME`; `OPS-1` (built `dist`, which also removes the
      worker's 6 s import, `VOICE-4`) ships with it. (b) Vercel project for `apps/web` with the
      three production `VITE_` values. (c) `REL-8` auth URLs to the Vercel origin. (d) DNS for
      the API at Caddy. (e) The smoke: `/health`, one streamed turn from the PWA, one in-app call
      against the hosted worker (`REL-5`), the Lighthouse audit (`REL-4`), and the live checklist
      of `docs/VOICE.md` with the figures recorded as the hosted baseline. (f) DPAs with Hetzner
      and Vercel noted in `OPS-5`. Done when a call from the PWA reaches the hosted worker with
      every developer machine off.

- [x] REL-1 · Part 2: apply `20261028100000_users.sql`, `20261028100100_ai_sessions_and_messages.sql` and
      `20261028100200_voice_calls.sql` to the dev project `kdplqbldohrzsewhckgl` (`supabase link` then
      `supabase db push`, both run by the operator), enable pg_cron (Dashboard → Database → Extensions)
      and re-run the last DO block of the voice_calls migration so `voice-calls-sweep` is scheduled.
      Check after applying: `select jobname, schedule from cron.job` shows `voice-calls-sweep` every
      minute, and the sweep's DELETE really removes a row (it has run nowhere yet, `DB-3`): as the
      service role insert a `voice_calls` row with `expires_at = now() - interval '1 minute'` (and
      one with `last_seen_at = now() - interval '4 minutes'`), wait for the next minute, and see
      both rows gone while a live row stays; the newest `cron.job_run_details` row for the job
      has `status = 'succeeded'`. Sign up a user and see a `public.users` row appear; then
      `/db-types` and commit `packages/db/src/database.ts`.
      Also check whether `DB-1` reproduces on the project's image.

- [x] REL-2 · Part 5: the live checklist of `docs/plan/05-voice-worker.md` §10 ran on 2026-10-29
      (`docs/VOICE.md` → The live checklist): worker, greeting, answers, rows, hang-up, bench and
      latency all verified; barge-in 7/7 in `vad` mode and 5/5 (slower) in `stt`, short of the
      20-try count. Still open: the full 20 tries once a take reliably provokes a long answer, and
      the bench against a database that has the demo tables (`CORE-2`).

- [x] REL-3 · Part 5: apply `20261029100000_demo_tables.sql` to the dev project (after `REL-1`, by the
      operator), then `/db-types`, commit `packages/db/src/database.ts`, and drop the `DemoDatabase`
      cast in `packages/tools-demo/src/demo-db.ts`. Check after applying: as a signed-in user
      `select count(*) from demo_items` works and an insert is refused; the dev project has no demo
      rows until someone loads them (the seed is local only).

- [ ] REL-4 · Part 6: a Lighthouse "installable" audit of the built PWA (the `build` then
      `preview` scripts of `@va/web`, or the deployed HTTPS origin) and a DevTools check
      that Cache Storage holds only the precached shell after a streamed turn. The build was
      inspected on 2026-10-29 (manifest, `sw.js` with `NetworkOnly` for both backend origins);
      the audit itself was not run.

- [ ] REL-5 · Part 6: a voice call from the PWA's call button with the worker running
      (`docs/VOICE.md` → Running locally): the agent is heard, the "Poziv u tijeku" banner shows,
      mute and hang-up work, and `voice_calls` loses its row on hang-up. Not run on 2026-10-29
      (the worker was not started in the session that built the button).

- [ ] REL-6 · Part 7: the operations pieces nobody has run. (a) `compose.dev.yml`: `supabase start`,
      export `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, put `api.env` and `voice.env` in `~/.config/va/`, then
      `docker compose -f compose.dev.yml up --build api web`; check `curl localhost:3000/health`
      and a sign-in at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. (b) Done locally on 2026-10-29: the three images build, the web image serves the
      shell with the caching rules, the api and voice images fail fast naming the missing
      variables and the api image answers `/health`; watch the first `docker (*)` CI jobs on this
      branch's pull request. (c) The repository secrets for
      `e2e.yml` (`E2E_SUPABASE_URL` = the dev project URL, which must equal the
      `E2E_ALLOWED_SUPABASE_URL` the workflow hardcodes, `E2E_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, optional
      `E2E_API_URL`, `E2E_EMAIL`, `E2E_PASSWORD` for a test user created on the dev project after
      `REL-1`), then one manual run of the workflow (`OPS-6`). (d) Diff each `apps/*/env.example` against the matrix in `docs/OPS.md`: the
      session that wrote the matrix could not read the example files (they were `.env.example`,
      under the harness deny, until 2026-11-02), so a stale comment or a missing name there is
      possible; `X01`–`X03` only check the matrix against the code. (e) Done 2026-11-02 (`B-5`):
      the example files are `apps/<app>/env.example`, outside the deny, and
      `apps/web/env.example` lists `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` and
      `VITE_API_URL` with a one-line comment each and no values.

- [x] REL-7 · DB-2: apply `20261102100000_voice_calls_expiry_cap.sql` to the dev project (after
      `REL-1`, by the operator). Check after applying: `select conname from pg_constraint where
conname = 'voice_calls_expires_within_cap'` returns one row, and as the service role an
      insert into `voice_calls` with `expires_at = now() + interval '16 minutes'` is refused with
      `23514`. Then `/db-types`: a CHECK changes no generated type, so expect
      `packages/db/src/database.ts` unchanged; commit it if it moves.

- [ ] REL-8 · DB-4: point the hosted dev project's auth URLs at the PWA (the `config.toml` change
      covers the local stack only). In the Dashboard (Authentication → URL Configuration) set
      `site_url` to the PWA's origin and the redirect allow-list to the PWA's origin(s) and the
      local dev origins (`http://localhost:5173`, `http://127.0.0.1:5173`, the compose origin
      `8080`); never the API's. Check after: a sign-up confirmation or a magic link from the dev
      project opens the PWA, not the API; `supabase link` and a `supabase db push --dry-run` report
      no config drift once the hosting origin (`OPS-3`) is known and written into `config.toml`.
