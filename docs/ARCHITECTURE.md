# Architecture

One shared engine behind every channel. This file is the map; each package has its own doc
(`docs/<PACKAGE>.md`), and the decisions behind the shape are in `docs/decisions/`. The product is
used from the car, so the phone number is the first channel to build (decision 0012,
`docs/plan/11-phone-channel.md`); the in-app call and the PWA below are as built, and the PWA's
role is the companion: where a call's turns, drafts and links are reviewed afterwards. The order
of the integrations is `docs/plan/10-integration-roadmap.md`.

## Dependency direction

```
web ──HTTP──▶ api ──▶ core ──▶ db
              voice ─▶ core ──▶ db
              tools-* ─▶ core (defineTool, log and types)
              api, voice ─▶ tools-* (an app composes the packs it registers; a pack never imports an app)
              api, voice ─▶ integrations ─▶ db, core (log)   (decision 0016)
```

`@va/integrations` holds what both processes need to act on a user's outside account: the
sealed tokens, the Microsoft OAuth and `tokenFor`. A pack never imports it; the app builds the
token store and hands a pack a token function, so `tools-* → core` stays the packs' only edge.

`core` never imports an app, never does HTTP, never imports LiveKit or React. Packages are
imported through their root (`@va/core`), never through `src/` (ESLint). Inside an app the layers
are `routes/` or `components/` → `hooks/` → `services/` → clients; web hooks never import the
Supabase client (ESLint).

## One picture

 phone (Part 11) ──PSTN──▶ SIP trunk ───┘  the worker resolves the caller from the number, asks a
                                           keypad PIN where the role needs one, mints a 15-min JWT,
                                           writes its own ai_sessions + voice_calls rows, then the
                                           same path
```

One brain: one loop, one tool registry, one role gate, one prompt lineage. Channels differ only
through an `EventSink`, a `MessageStore`, `LoopHooks` and a `ChannelSettings` row.

`phone` (Part 11) takes the voice column throughout; `whatsapp` (roadmap step 6) will too.

## Data

Nine tables, all with RLS: `users` (one profile per auth user; `role` gates tools, `language`
picks the presentation), `ai_sessions` (one conversation per row; `channel` already allows
chat, voice, whatsapp and phone), `ai_messages` (one Anthropic message per row, a tree through
`parent_id`; `turn_kind` separates real user turns from tool results) and `voice_calls` (the
caller's JWT handed to the voice worker by an opaque token, service role only),
`voice_caller_identities` (the phone channel's enrolled numbers with their keypad PIN hash and
lockout, service role only, Part 11; `ai_sessions.caller_identity_id` points at it),
`tool_confirmations` (the write protocol's confirmations and audit, Part 12),
`user_integrations` (a user's Microsoft 365 connection: sealed OAuth tokens, service role only;
the owner reads its state columns, Part 13a), plus the example
pack's `demo_items` (a company-wide catalogue, read by every signed-in user) and `demo_notes`
(owner-scoped). Signed-in users
read their own sessions and messages; every write goes through the API with the service role.
`ai_session_history(leaf, max_rows)` is the bounded history read. Details, grants and the seed
users are in `docs/DB.md`.

## Where things live

Every later part extends this table.
