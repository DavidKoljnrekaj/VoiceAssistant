# Request for the Landmark repository: the `assistant-api` edge function

**For:** David, working in `/home/user/Dev/Pannonia/Landmark` (by hand or with a Claude Code
session there). The assistant repository does not change Landmark; this document is everything
the assistant needs from it. The assistant's side is `docs/plan/14-landmark-pack.md` §3.

**Safety rails, before anything else:** work on a branch from `development`; deploy only to the
dev project `nxvbglegqcgxlxvyfuht`; never deploy to, link or run SQL against the production
project `xhlgviunhitdgzkeucxc` until you decide to release it. No migration is needed.

## What it does

A small edge function that lets the company assistant ask Landmark's existing AI-chat tools a
question on behalf of an employee, and get back exactly what Landmark's own chat would. It adds no
query of its own: it reuses `_shared/auth.ts` (identity and role), `_shared/orchestrator.ts`
(`dispatchTool`, which already gates by role and channel) and `_shared/tools.ts` (the catalogue,
the `voice` allowlist and `DOMAIN_RULES_HR`).

## Paste-ready prompt for a Claude Code session in the Landmark repo

```
Read CLAUDE.md, docs/AI_CHAT.md and docs/voice/02-voice-implementation-plan.md §5. Then implement
the edge function described in /home/user/Dev/Pannonia/VoiceAssistant/docs/requests/landmark-assistant-api-request.md
on a branch feat/assistant-api from development. Reuse authenticateToken, dispatchTool,
selectAvailableTools and DOMAIN_RULES_HR; do not change any existing handler, prompt or tool. Do not
deploy, link or run SQL against any project. Write Deno tests for every route and refusal in that
document, run `deno task check` and `deno task test`, update supabase/config.toml and write
docs/ASSISTANT_API.md. Report what you built and how you verified it.
```

## The function

Files:

```
supabase/functions/assistant-api/index.ts      routes, the assertion check, the mapping, dispatch
supabase/functions/assistant-api/assertion.ts  verify the caller's signed assertion (HS256, `npm:jose`)
supabase/functions/assistant-api/session.ts    a Landmark user session for the mapped user (magic link)
supabase/functions/assistant-api/voice.ts      the voice clamps
supabase/functions/assistant-api/tests/        Deno tests
supabase/config.toml                           [functions.assistant-api] verify_jwt = false, commented like voice-llm
docs/ASSISTANT_API.md                          this contract, as built
```

### 1. Who is calling: the assertion

Every request carries `Authorization: Bearer <assertion>`: an HS256 JWT signed with the secret
`ASSISTANT_API_SECRET` (function secret; the assistant holds the same value). Verify, in order:
signature, `alg` is `HS256`, `iss` is `va`, `aud` is `landmark-assistant-api`, `exp` in the future
and no more than 60 s after `iat`, `jti` present and not seen in the last 120 s (keep seen `jti`s
in memory; a cold start forgetting them is acceptable for a 60 s token), `sub` is an email
address. Any failure is `401 bad_assertion`, logged with the reason and no claim values.

### 2. Which Landmark user: the mapping

`sub` is the employee's email. With the service client, find the `public.users` row whose `email`
equals it (case-insensitive) and that has an `auth_user_id`. None: `403 not_mapped`.

Then get a real session for that user, so every handler reads under RLS exactly as in Landmark's
chat: `auth.admin.generateLink({ type: 'magiclink', email })` with the service client, then
`auth.verifyOtp({ token_hash, type: 'magiclink' })` on a client built with the anon key; take
`session.access_token`; pass it to `authenticateToken(jwt)`, which re-reads the role and assigned
projects. Never log the link, the hash or the token. After the request, revoke it with
`auth.admin.signOut(access_token, 'local')` (best effort, logged on failure).

### 3. Routes

All `POST`, JSON in and out. Failures are `{ "error": { "code": "…", "message": "…" } }` with a real
status.

| Route                         | Body                                             | Answer                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/assistant-api/me`           | `{}`                                             | `{ "role": "Director", "display_name": "…", "tools": { "chat": [names], "voice": [names] } }` from `selectAvailableTools(ctx, channel)`                                                     |
| `/assistant-api/manifest`     | `{}`                                             | `{ "version": "<sha256 of the JSON below>", "tools": [{ "name", "description", "input_schema", "roles", "voice": true/false }], "domain_rules_hr": DOMAIN_RULES_HR }` for the exposed tools |
| `/assistant-api/tools/<name>` | `{ "input": {…}, "channel": "chat" \| "voice" }` | `{ "data": … }`: what `dispatchTool(name, input, ctx, extras, channel)` returned, voice-clamped when the channel is `voice`                                                                 |

**Exposed tools:** the twelve of `TOOL_ALLOWLIST.voice` (the v1 voice list in the voice plan §5).
`create_document`, `list_documents_for_entity` and `get_document_download_link` are not exposed:
a tool outside the twelve is `404 unknown_tool` on both channels.

**Refusals:** a tool the role may not use on that channel is `403 forbidden_tool` (dispatch's
refusal, mapped); input failing the tool's schema is `400 bad_request`; a handler error is
`500 internal_error` with the handler's code logged; more than 30 tool calls per user per minute is
`429 rate_limited`.

**Voice clamps** (`voice.ts`, applied to `data` when `channel` is `voice`): arrays cut to 5 items
with a `total` kept beside them; free-text fields over 200 characters clipped. Ids stay in the data
(the assistant needs them to chain calls; its own prompt forbids reading them aloud).

### 4. Logging

One line per request: route, tool name, channel, status, mapped `public.users.id`, timings. Never
the input, the output, the email, the assertion or any token.

### 5. Tests (Deno)

- Each assertion failure (bad signature, wrong `aud`, wrong `iss`, expired, `exp − iat` > 60 s,
  reused `jti`, `alg: none`) is `401 bad_assertion`.
- An unknown email is `403 not_mapped`; a user row without `auth_user_id` likewise.
- `/me` for a Director lists the twelve on voice; for Sales, seven (the voice plan's count).
- A finance tool called as Sales is `403 forbidden_tool`; `create_document` is `404 unknown_tool`.
- A voice call to a list tool returns at most 5 items with `total`.
- `/manifest` is stable: two calls give the same `version`.
- No test or log line contains the email, the assertion or a token.

### 6. Deploy to the dev project, when ready

```sh
supabase link --project-ref nxvbglegqcgxlxvyfuht
supabase secrets set ASSISTANT_API_SECRET=<the value the assistant team gives you>
supabase functions deploy assistant-api
```

Then tell the assistant side the function's URL
(`https://nxvbglegqcgxlxvyfuht.supabase.co/functions/v1/assistant-api`) and confirm the pilot
user's email exists in that project's `public.users` with the Director role.

## What comes back to the assistant side

1. The function URL on the dev project.
2. The `/manifest` JSON (or let the assistant session pull it with the secret).
3. Confirmation that the pilot Director's email is mapped in the dev project.
